## Components used

### [twig/twig](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig)

I could have used [Smarty](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty),
but I wanted to show that other templating librairies were available.

### [intervention/image](http://image.intervention.io/)

It's simply the best image manipulation tool I met.
Its methods are very similar to imgix ones.

### [erusev/parsedown-extra](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown-extra)

Because I love [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Because I know some of my colleagues do
(Hello Nicolas and Alexis). And because every rich text coming from 
anything but a template should use Markdown.
